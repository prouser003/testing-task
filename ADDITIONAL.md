### Things mentioned here are done in simple way just to save time   

##### Things to improve:  
+ styles for searchBox are written in global css, better to write custom search box component  
+ for images used regular img instead of 'next/image' because of domains issue  
+ better to make css variables for reuse of colors etc  
+ at the moment algolia searches by default prop  
+ a lot of things can be made for SEO (meta tags, static pages if there are not too much news)  
+ see issue with custom fonts

#### Things are not done because need additional info:
+ No vertical cards in header
+ For now I can implement item page only with mock data
