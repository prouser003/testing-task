### Things mentioned here are simplified just to save time   

#### Things to improve:  
+ styles for searchBox are written in global css, better to write custom search box component  
+ for images used regular img instead of 'next/image' because of domains issue
+ would improve images sizes to fit properly in container
+ at the moment algolia searches by default prop  
+ a lot of things can be made for SEO (meta tags, static pages if there are not too much news)
+ news in header made with algolia widget, I suppose there is another way

#### Things are not done because need additional info:
+ Implemented item page only with mock data, but in regular case it would be nice to fetch full news content
from contentful by slug or id
